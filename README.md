# Talklio

In the wake of Covid-19, university student communities have been fragmented by online learning, quarantine mandates, and social distancing requirements. Frankly, university just isn't as fun anymore.

Talklio is an app to foster connectedness among UCL students in a fresh format, bringing together remote and on-campus students. It's a live social media feed bursting with opinions, pro-tips, confessionals, and jokes. 

The app features three sections: In a live image feed, you can see what other UCL students are up to - all raw, unfiltered, and spontaneous. At a random time each day, you get a notification to snap a picture of yourself in a two-minute timeframe. Unless you post yourself, you cannot see the pictures of others. Snap quick!
In a Q&A section, give your hot take on polarizing questions and see how the UCL community ticks. Ever wondered if anyone else shared your unpopular opinions? Check Talklio!
In an advice column, ask for and receive real-time advice on all life situations, completely anonymous. Picking an outfit for date night, oversleeping your job interview, or handling a friendship break-up - we've got you covered.

Take a peek into UCL's hive mind with Talklio.
